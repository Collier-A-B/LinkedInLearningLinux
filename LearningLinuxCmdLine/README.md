# Learning Linux Command Line (LinkedIn Learning Course)

This is the first course in the *Ubuntu Linux Professional Certificate* Learning Path on LinkedIn Learning

## Folder Structure

This directory contains my personal notes from the course.  
Each section of videos in the course will have it's own directory and notes.md file.  
Each notes.md will contain notes for each video in the section, seperated by a header with the video title and label (e.g. video 1)
